Key learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building a responsive user interface using HTML and CSS, and deepened my understanding of UX design principles. I also learned how to use media queries for mobile responsiveness and how to structure content clearly and accessibly.

Challenges faced

One major challenge was ensuring the layout remained user-friendly across different screen sizes. Initially, the design broke on smaller devices, but I overcame this by implementing flexible units and media queries. Another challenge was clearly communicating medicine statuses, which I solved using a color-coded legend that is both intuitive and visually accessible.
